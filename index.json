    "summary": "DocFX Documentation Pipeline This repository contains the source files for the documentation site and an Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline to automatically build and deploy the documentation. How It Works The Azure DevOps pipeline follows this workflow: Triggers when changes are pushed to the main branch or when pull requests targeting the main branch are created Builds the DocFX documentation site If the build is successful and the changes are on the main branch, commits the generated _site folder to the public-docs-site repository Pipeline Configuration azure-pipelines.yml - Azure DevOps pipeline definition Setup Requirements To use this pipeline, you need to set up the following: Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with the following permissions: If the target repository is private: repo scope (Full control of private repositories) If the target repository is public: public_repo scope (Access to public repositories) These permissions are required to push to the target repository (https://github.com/XMPro/public-docs-site.git) Important: Make sure the GitHub account associated with the PAT has write access to the target repository. If you're getting a 403 error (Permission denied), it means the account doesn't have the necessary permissions to push to the repository. The pipeline now uses a classic PAT token stored in the DOCS_DEPLOY_PAT_CLASSIC variable, which should have the necessary permissions to push directly to the target repository. Add the classic PAT as a pipeline variable or secret: Go to your Azure DevOps project Navigate to Pipelines > Library Create a new Variable Group or edit an existing one Add a new variable named DOCS_DEPLOY_PAT_CLASSIC Set the value to your GitHub classic PAT Check the \"Keep this value secret\" option Save the variable group Alternatively, you can add it directly to your pipeline: Go to your pipeline Click \"Edit\" Click the \"Variables\" button Add a new variable named DOCS_DEPLOY_PAT_CLASSIC Set the value to your GitHub classic PAT Check the \"Keep this value secret\" option Save the pipeline Local Development To build the documentation locally: Install .NET 8.0 SDK (required for the latest version of DocFX) Install DocFX: dotnet tool install -g docfx Navigate to the public-documentation directory: cd public-documentation Run docfx docfx.json to build the site The generated site will be in the public-documentation/_site folder File Structure public-documentation/docfx.json - Configuration file for DocFX public-documentation/index.md - Main landing page public-documentation/toc.yml - Table of contents public-documentation/docs/ - Documentation content azure-pipelines.yml - Azure DevOps pipeline definition .gitignore - Configured to ignore the _site folder in this repository Notes The _site folder is ignored in this repository (via .gitignore) because it contains the build output that is automatically deployed to the target repository. Only changes to the main branch will trigger a deployment to the target repository."
